	<h3>{{ project.title }}</h3>

	<p>This was a project I started back in november 2017 when I first learned python. I was the sole creator/developer
		for the first year of the project before I was able to hire help.
		<br>
		<br>
		The system stored fuel sample data for the entire lab and provided an interface for lab chemists and admins to
		view, add and send data to clients.
		<br>
		<br>
		Lab results would be generated by the system in PDF form and automatically sent to the client along with an
		interface for customers to be able to login and view.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to view all their data with a dynamic search form, trend data, add notes to reports
		and even map their samples' physical location.
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this system for 2 years before selling this to FOI Laboratories.</p>
